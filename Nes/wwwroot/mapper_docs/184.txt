Example Games:
--------------------------
Atlantis no Nazo
The Wing of Madoola


Registers:
--------------------------
  $6000-7FFF:  [.HHH .LLL]
    H = Selects 4k CHR @ $1000
    L = Selects 4k CHR @ $0000

Regs at $6000-7FFF means no SRAM
The most significant bit of H is always set in hardware. (i.e. its range is 4 to 7)
